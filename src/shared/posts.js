    As its official tagline states, React is a library for building user interfaces.
    React is not a framework – it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with other libraries to render to certain environments.
    For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile applications; React 360 can be used to build virtual reality applications;
    and there are other possibilities besides.

    To build for the web, developers use React in tandem with ReactDOM. 
    React and ReactDOM are often discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve the same problems
     as — other true web development frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", we’re working with that 
     colloquial understanding.

    React's primary goal is to minimize the bugs that occur when developers are building UIs. 
    It does this through the use of components — self-contained, logical pieces of code that describe a portion of the user interface. 
    These components can be composed together to create a full UI, and React abstracts away much of the rendering work, 
    leaving you to concentrate on the UI design.
